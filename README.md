# BubbleCounter

In this project, I am working on a arduino code that will log the bubbles passing through a water-lock.
The purpose of this is to keep track of the fermentation process.
Currently I count the bubbles within a minute and compare with the previous day.
I would like to let someone/something else to do this.

The arduino board has a data logger shield and an LCD screen.
Additionally, an IR gate is attatched to an analogue pin on the board.

To directly know where the process is, a few values need to be calculated.
Additionally, I would like to be able to plot out the volumetric rate of gas over time.
Under the shaky assumption that all bubbles are made equal.
